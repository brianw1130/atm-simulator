# Known architectural trade-offs for ATM Simulator infrastructure.
# These findings are acknowledged and acceptable for the current deployment model.
# TODO: Revisit when migrating to a private-subnet + NAT gateway architecture.

# Fargate needs HTTPS egress to 0.0.0.0/0 for AWS service access (ECR, CloudWatch,
# Secrets Manager). Proper fix: VPC endpoints for each service.

# ECR image tag mutability — acceptable for dev/staging; production deployments
# use explicit image digests in the ECS task definition.

# Public subnet auto-assigns public IP — required because the architecture uses
# public subnets without a NAT gateway (cost optimization).
AVD-AWS-0164

# RDS publicly accessible — required for public-subnet Fargate connectivity
# without VPC endpoints. Security group restricts access to Fargate SG only.

# S3 bucket uses AWS-managed encryption (SSE-S3) instead of customer-managed KMS key.
# Acceptable for statement PDFs; no PII in stored files.
